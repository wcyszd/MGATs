**Please note that since there will be further optimization and improvement in this work, and this point is also a part of my graduation thesis, the complete and latest code will be released after some time, but not too long.**

The datasets required for the experiments can be found at the following location: https://github.com/wcyszd/MGATs/tree/main/datasets.

Some of the code used in the experimental code can be found at the following location: https://github.com/wcyszd/MGATs/tree/main/gnn-benchmark-master.

In the future, I will continue to organize and upload more comprehensive documentation and code. Thank you for your attention.
